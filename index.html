			<h2>Welcome to Art Basel</h2>
			<h3>Miami's International Art Festival</h3>

			<p>Since 1970, Art Basel’s goal has been to connect the world's premier galleries and their patrons,
				as well serving as a meeting point for the international artworld. Now, over forty years later,
				its three fairs - in Basel, Hong Kong and Miami Beach - rank as the premier shows of their kind,
				presenting 20th and 21st century art with a strong curatorial perspective.</p>

			 <p>Our reputation for showing high quality work has attracted leading international galleries and collectors,
				 offering visitors the most important art from around the world.</p>

       <p> An internationally-acclaimed artist, curator, painter, writer and activist, Viviana Puello is highly
	       recognized for her work as the diligent Art Director of the acclaimed ArtTourInternational Magazine - a
	       prestigious publication that, issue after issue, is winning the hearts of so many artists and taking the
	       art world by storm.</p>

	       <p>Viviana Puello has worked as an artist and curator for over 20 years and is also the founder of the
	       Vivid Arts Network, an international art organization that serves as a platform for professional and emerging
	       artists looking to receive international exposure. With Vivid Arts Network, Puello’s efforts as an activist
	       for the cause of abolishing human trafficking are directed towards helping ECPAT International - an association
	       that helps heal victims and creates programs for the prevention of this crippling social issue (www.ecpat.com).</p>

	       <p>In 2011, Puello founded ArtTourInternational Magazine; after 10 months of research and preparation made possible
	       with the help of her creative team, the first issue of the magazine was published in December 2011 and distributed
	       to fifteen hundred readers and artist friends. Today, ArtTour International Magazine has over 2 million readers
	       and is present in over 60 countries - an accomplishment that Puello attributes to the great crew of people behind
	       the publication and the great network of artists that take part in each issue.</p>

	       <p>Puello splits her time between Italy and her beloved New York, the city in which she gained experience while
	       working for a notable TV Station.  After founding ArtTour International Magazine and seeing its great success,
	       Puello founded the ATIM WEB TV Channel where she uses her past experience in journalism and communications to
	       expose contemporary artists through the live broadcasting of events and the “Art 2 Heart” interviews she does
	       while traveling with her team.</p>

	      <p> Viviana Puello started her career as an artist in her native Colombia at a very early age; growing up in Cartagena
	       , a bohemian city that kisses the Atlantic Ocean, art was always an essential part of her early life. Puello
	       started painting at the age of twelve, surprising everyone with her talent. Her works were initially inspired
	       by Colombian artists whom she looked up to like Fernando Botero and Alejandro Obregon. Puello is collected
	       internationally and has premiered in film, television, and theatre.</p>

	       <p>She lives and works in Ferrara Italy with her husband, Alan Grimandi, CO-director of the Vivid Arts Network
	       organization and Video Producer for the ATIM WEB TV Channel.  Puello enjoys painting, writing, traveling and,
	       in her spare time, working on her farm where she can enjoy quiet respites in between her trips.</p>

	       <p>Most recentely Viviana Puello has been awarded with the Grand Medal of Honor by the National Academy of Fine
	       Arts in Brazil.</p>
